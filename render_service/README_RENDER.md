# Deal Analytics API on Render (Scaffold)

This is a minimal FastAPI app used to:

1. Run locally and test the API "frontend" from the local machine.
2. Deploy the same code to Render and confirm the network path:
   Local machine -> HTTPS -> Render -> FastAPI.

No database integration is included yet.

## 1. Run locally

From the project root:

```bash
cd render_service
